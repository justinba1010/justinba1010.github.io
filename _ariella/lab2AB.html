        <blockquote><u>What happens to a dream deferred?</u><br>

            Does it dry up<br>
            like a raisin in the sun?<br>
            Or fester like a sore—<br>
            And then run?<br>
            Does it stink like rotten meat?<br>
            Or crust and sugar over—<br>
            like a syrupy sweet?<br>
      
            Maybe it just sags<br>
            like a heavy load.<br>
      
            <em>Or does it explode?</em></blockquote>
            <h1>Charles Babbage</h1>
            <p><strong>Charles Babbage </strong>was born on December 26, 1791, in London, and later died on October 18, 1871. During his life, he taught math at the University of Cambridge, where he was the Lucasian Professor. He assisted in the development of the Royal Astronomical, Analytical, and Statistical Societies. Additionally, he was elected to the Royal Society of London and helped form the postal system in England. His inventions include a speedometer, locomotive cowcatcher, and a calculator that could compute up to eight decimals!</p>
            <p>The Analytical Engine is one of his most famous projects. Ada Lovelace, later on, translated a paper about it and stated it's potential on becoming the first computer program. The incomplete project was forgotten along with Babbage's design up until 1937. Babbage obtained government support for another one of his projects called the Difference Engine. Additionally, Babbage invented the earliest automatic digital computer. All in all, Babbage's contributions were astounding and the backbone of the computers we use today.</p>
