        <h2>My Pandemic Experience</h2>
        <p>During the pandemic, I learned a lot about myself and learned a few new hobbies. Up until mother's day I was quarentined in Charleston with one of my best friends. It was a fun experience where we just cooked new foods and watched television.</p>
        <p>We also explored the outdoors more than ever before. Since the beaches were closed, we had to find a replacement. We found a park called Dimitri Park on James Island with a dock and a mini beach. We bought tubes and would spend a lot of our time there until we would get kicked out.</p>
        <p>When I finally went home to my parents in May the quarentine became quite boring but I was also very appreciative of the time I got to spend with my parents. I got into a good workout routine being home and showed them my new cooking skills. Overall, I enjoyed my experience in the pandemic but am ready to go back to normal and, more speicifically, in person classes.</p>
        <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
        <p>On 1815, the "first computer programmer," Ada Lovelace was born in London. She was tutored in science and math which was unusual for a woman but her mother pushed her to study hard. She studied and became involved with math at the University of London.</p>
        <p>Although she was alive during 1815-1852, her work was not recognized until the 1950s. In one of her famous works she was asked to translate. She ended up translating it and adding her own comment, tripling the size of the original article, which was published in 1843. That same work was republished again in 1953 by B.V. Bowden. In 1980, "Ada," a computer language was named after Lovelace by the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
