        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        <p style="line-height: 2;">I'm going to show my friends dogs on this webpage. I asked them to all send me picture of their dogs. In this webpage I'm going to describe them briefly and show a picture. They're all amazing and very sweet.</p>
        <h2 class="right">Emily's Dog</h2>
        <h3 class="right">Emily's dog is a mini labradoodle. His name is Buddy and hes very young so he's kinda crazy.</h3>
        <h4>Photo</h4>
        <div><img src="All_images_lab4/Emilydog.jpg" alt="Labradoodle"></div>
        <h2>Mike's Dog</h2>
        <h3>Mike's dog is a Shiba Inu. His dog's name is Cannoli. Cannoli is also super sweet.</h3>
        <h4>Photo</h4>
        <div><img class="right" src="All_images_lab4/Mikedog.png" alt="Shiba Inu"></div>
        <h2>Aiden's Dogs</h2>
        <h3>My friend Aiden has two dogs and they are both Beagle mixes. Their names are Zwingly and Lola. They are 8 and 2 respectively.</h3>
        <h4>Photo</h4>
        <div><img src="All_images_lab4/Aidendogs.jpg" alt="Beagle"></div>
        <h2>Zach's Dog</h2>
        <h3>Zach's dog is a Boxer and she's 3. I've actually never met his dog because I met him at school but from what I'm told she's really sweet.</h3>
        <h4>Photo</h4>
        <div><img src="All_images_lab4/Zachdog.jpg" alt="Boxer"></div>
        <p id="conclusion">To conclude my webpage I would like to thank my friends for participating and sending pictures. Since I am at school I can't see my friends dogs very often anymore which makes me sad. I have always wanted a dog so them having one makes me happy when I go over to their place.</p>
