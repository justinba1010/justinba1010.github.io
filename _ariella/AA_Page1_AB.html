        <article id="hack"><h2>Hacking</h2></article>
        <p class="red">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible for a voting system to be hacked and the vote can potentially be changed from who the original voter intended to vote for. Moreover, Dominick ends his article with “one could virtually guarantee that it would be hacked.” The response from officials was along the lines of We know but there’s nothing we can do. 
             </p>
             <h2>My Stance</h2>
            <p class="red">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I found very interesting is that 3 out of the top 4 reasons people did not vote in previous elections are because people were too busy, traveling for the holidays, and too busy with work or school (Smith). I think electronic voting could potentially increase voter turnout but I think the risks outweigh the benefits. It is too easy for people to hack into the systems or vote for other people. I think we should stick with going to the polls and having our IDs checked when voting.</p>
