# Resources

## Real World Architecture Exploitation

* [Spectre: Exploitation of Speculative Execution](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
* [Meltdown: Exploitation of Out of Order Execution](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
* [Youtube - Run Your Own Buffer Overflow Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo)

## Texts

* [Code - Charles Petzoid](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319/ref=zg_bs_3508_44?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=H6MVQWNG8Y6XF1PZ1X87)
  * If you are new to computing, I HIGHLY recommend this. Unless you feel confident that you understand computers from bottom up, read this
* [NAND to Tetris, not a textbook](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
  * If you are actually interested in building computers from bottom up
* [Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs - Ableson, Sussman & Sussman](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871)
  * I have not personally read this, but it's one of the "Holy Texts of CS with TAOCP
* [The Art of Computer Programming - Knuth](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Programming-Volumes-1-4A-Boxed/dp/0321751043/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=taocp&qid=1630290758&s=books&sr=1-1)
  * If you hate yourself, but want to be a god after a few years of reading
* [Introduction to Automata Theory - Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Languages-Computation/dp/0321455363/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CI6JGC1TA25X&dchild=1&keywords=introduction+to+automata+theory+hopcroft&qid=1630290805&s=books&sprefix=Introduction+to+Automata%2Cstripbooks%2C273&sr=1-1)
  * The de facto Theoretical CS text, was very good when I took 551, highly recommend
* [Introduction to Algorithms - Cormen, Leierson, Rivest, Stein](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=clrs&qid=1630290951&s=books&sr=1-3)
  * Is the de-facto text for algorithms, very dense, I only recommend it as a reference text
  * [Algorithms - Levitin](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Design-Analysis-Algorithms-3rd/dp/0132316811/ref=sr_1_32?dchild=1&keywords=algorithms&qid=1630290887&s=books&sr=1-32)
    * I can actually recommend reading this, very easy to follow along

## Recommendations

* There are many legendary texts in CS. The Dragon Book, The Wizard Book(SICP), Tannenbaum's OS, TAOCP, etc. As an undergraduate, unless you take a graduate level course your odds of reading one are low, unless you take it upon yourself. I can't recommend reading them all, I haven't, BUT if you can; pick a topic you're interested in and read the high level text for it. You will get a deeper understanding, be able to say(hopefully) you are proficient in some sub-field. 
* Pick a math subject or two, and buy the texts and learn them.
* Do not skimp on your other courses, hobbies, passions.
