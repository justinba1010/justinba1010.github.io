       <h3>Summary of Good Will Hunting</h3>
       <p>Good Will Hunting is a great movie about Matt Damon. He starts off as a janitor at MIT. He anonymously solves all the very difficultproblems put on the board. A professor decides to help him take his life in the right direction and along the way he meets a girl.</p>

       <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
       <p>This movie is a <strong>classic</strong> for me. I watched it for the first time in my psychology class 3 years ago. Since then I've probably watched it <em>10 times and it never gets old. </em>I consider this movie one of my all time favorite movies. </p>
