        <h3>Friends</h3>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my favorite things to do in my free time is to spend it with my closest friends! </p><br>

           <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shown above are a few of my friends from where I grew up. I miss them a lot and hopefully I get to see them over break.</strong></p><br><br>

            <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this picture are some of my friends that I made this year. I'm so grateful that I met people like them.</strong></p>
        <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I enjoy doing in my free time is playing sports. Growing up I always played a lot of sports all year round including track, basketball, and volleyball for a few years.</p>
      <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the youngest of 4. I have two older half sisters and one brother who's only 2 years older. I mostly grew up with my older brother because my two older sisters were a lot older and had moved out by the time I got to middle school.</p>

      <h3>Life Story</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived in a very small town my entire life up until I left for school. I am originally from NJ but moved to Charleston, SC August of 2019. I moved in order to get residency in SC because USC was the school I wanted to go to but paying out-of-state tuition was not in my budget. I then transferred to USC this year and am very excited to continue my education here. I'm not quite sure what I want to do after school but I really hope I decide soon :) </p>
