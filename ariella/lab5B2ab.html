        <h1 class="hover" class="class1">Technology during the Pandemic</h1>
       <p id="para1">Personally, technology has become a bigger part of my life during the pandemic and I'm sure many people can say the same. I have become more addicted to my phone and computer because there's not many places to go. I was never really a social media person but the Pandemic has definitely altered that a bit. Lastly, I had grocery shopped online for the first time during the pandemic back in May.</p>
       <h2 class="hover" class="class1">School</h2>
       <p>For starters classes are all online for me which is detrimental to my learning considering I'm a visual and physical learner. Additionally, we have been trained to learn in classrooms since preschool and in other words we associate schools and classrooms with learning. Now we are being forced to attend class from our beds or kitchens or houses in general. With the help of technology, we are able to continue to "go to school" during this pandemic. But are students getting the same learning experience?</p>
       <h2>Conclusion</h2>
       <p class="hover" class="class1">Technically, we could live our lives from the comfort of our own homes and rarely ever leave. We could order our groceries online, work from online, shop for almost anything on Amazon, etc. <mark>What happened to going to the mall to buy clothes? </mark>The amount of people who online shop is increasing due to the convenience but is this really a good thing?</p>
