        <h1 class="hover" class="class1">The Loss of Privacy Due to Technology</h1>
       <p id="para1">Technology has aided us in many ways including the medical field, in education, and in the business world. We have made ground breaking discoveries with the help of technology. We have increased the lifespan of humans and pets with the help of technology. We have made safer cars. And the list goes on and on. But, with this, technology has also taken away our privacy.</p>
       <h2 class="hover" class="class1">How</h2>
       <p>Computers know exactly what we search, what we buy, how much time we spend on our computers, etc. <mark>Computers also have a feature where every single password is saved and comes up as soon as you launch the website.</mark> Amazon's Echo aka Alexa listens to you at all times and will respond upon hearing her name. Our phone's do the exact same thing with Siri and if you're like me, phones are always within 10 feet of us.</p>
       <h2 class="hover">Conclusion</h2>
       <p class="class1">Privacy is important to some people and others don't really care. That's why some people put a piece of tape over their webcam. The book 1984 has something very similar called Big Brother which listens to the citizens at all times. I find that book very interesting but not too far off from where we are today with technology.</p>
