        <h4>Why Social Media is Bad</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most, social media is usually the highlights of our lives. When people go to the beach or go on vacation. Additionally, users post the best pictures of themselves and I've witnessed my friends take over a hundred pictures just to get one to post.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, personally, have a Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and maybe more. I don't really spend too much time going through what others post but when I do I can see that people are making their lives to be like a fairytale. This is bad because other young teens will see it and think negatively upon their life. Social media usage often leads to depression in young teens.</p>

        <h4>Social Media Usage</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 70% of people (in the US) use or have social media! Moreover, 97% of people aged 13-18 use social media. These numbers are crazy high and we need to take a step back, unplug, and think about what we are absorbing from social media.</p>
